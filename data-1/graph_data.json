These activities include manipulating software applications by sending malicious requests through them, bypassing security measures like firewalls, or utilizing hardware weaknesses such as improper isolation during boot phases, debug/test interfaces, and unpatched firmware updates.\n\nAttackers exploit inconsistencies in mirrored regions, cache copies, cryptographic operations vulnerabilities, side-channel attacks, hardware logic weaknesses, non-volatile memory flaws, voltage and clock glitches, fuse logic inconsistencies, and improper handling of overlap between protected memory ranges. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, attackers can perform privilege escalation attacks, modify system configurations, cause Denial of Service (DoS) conditions, extract sensitive data such as cryptographic keys, or capture passwords and session tokens transmitted in plaintext.\n\nAttackers also target improperly cleared memory and uncleared sensitive information left on reused resources like memory or disk space, along with undocumented features or debug interfaces to compromise security. The attacker’s methods involve exploiting specific vulnerabilities such as CVE-2010-1637 and CVE-2009-0037 to carry out unauthorized actions, leveraging improper access controls, hardware vulnerabilities, and software misconfigurations to gain unauthorized write access or manipulate system operations.\n\nFurthermore, attackers exploit processor vulnerabilities such as transient execution for side-channel analysis and Load Value Injection (LVI) attacks, modifying the MCHBAR register to overlap with an attacker-controlled region, preventing VT-d protection when a Measured Launch Environment is launched. They also target shared microarchitectural resources to infer private data through transient operations and covert channels.\n\nIn addition, attackers exploit weaknesses in volatile memory systems or specific hardware components like Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) paired with Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) or Static Random Access Memory (SRAM). Attackers use electromagnetic fault injection (EM-FI) to locally and dynamically modify signals of an integrated circuit, potentially bypassing security mechanisms such as secure JTAG or Secure Boot.\n\nThe attacker's strategies include path traversal techniques for accessing unintended file locations, injecting malicious commands into the system to execute arbitrary code or manipulate processes, appending special characters or sequences like trailing dots, encoded spaces, or slash characters to URLs for unauthorized access to source code and sensitive files. Attackers also exploit vulnerabilities such as external control of values and filenames to manipulate software applications and perform path traversal and file inclusion.\n\nMoreover, attackers exploit XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerabilities to carry out attacks on victims, input injection for executing arbitrary commands or programs, symbolic links for unauthorized access and overwriting files. They are capable of executing unauthorized code or commands, modifying files and directories, reading sensitive data, and causing Denial-of-Service (DoS) conditions by overwriting or deleting critical system files.\n\nIn summary, the attacker's strategies are diverse and multifaceted, targeting both hardware and software components to exploit weaknesses in system design and implementation for malicious purposes.",
